## 🛠 Project Description

This project involves developing a **tower defense game**, designed to give students hands-on experience with programming concepts and **development methodologies**.  

The game introduces **progressively challenging requirements** covering:  
✔ **Game Initialization**  
✔ **User Interaction**  
✔ **Gameplay Mechanics**  
✔ **Combat Scenarios**  

Although structured similarly to the **Waterfall Development model**, the project allows flexibility for necessary adjustments throughout the semester.

## 💻 Implementation Language

This game is developed in **Arduino**, emphasizing both **software** and potential **hardware interactions**. The goal is to help students bridge **theoretical programming knowledge** with **real-world applications**.

## 🚀 Features

### **Start & Configuration**  
🔹 **Game Initialization** – Players can start or quit the game, transitioning from the main screen to the game setup.  
🔹 **Character Customization** – Players input a character name with validation rules to ensure meaningful input.  
🔹 **Difficulty Settings** – Three difficulty levels impact starting resources and challenge intensity.  

### **Gameplay Mechanics**  
🔹 **Resource Management** – Players begin with a set amount of money (varies by difficulty) to purchase towers.  
🔹 **Strategic Planning** – Players must **defend a monument** by strategically placing towers along a path.  
🔹 **Tower Defense** – A variety of towers with **unique abilities** are available for purchase. **Placement restrictions** prevent towers from being placed on the path.  

### **Combat & Progression**  
🔹 **Combat Initiation** – Players **start combat sequences**, triggering enemy movement along the path.  
🔹 **Enemy Diversity** – Multiple enemy types, each with unique behaviors, **require adaptive defense strategies**.  
🔹 **Monument Health** – The monument’s health varies by difficulty. If enemies reach the monument, **health decreases**, leading to a potential **game over**.  

### **Advanced Features**  
🔹 **Tower Upgrades** – Players can upgrade towers to enhance their **attack and defense capabilities**.  
🔹 **Final Boss & Victory Conditions** – The final challenge is **defeating a powerful boss**. Victory provides **game statistics** and an option to restart or exit.
