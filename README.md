# Semester Project Overview

## Project Description
This project involves the development of a tower defense game, designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of programming concepts and the application of development methodologies. The game incorporates a series of progressively challenging requirements that cover game initialization, user interaction, gameplay mechanics, and combat scenarios. Although structured in a manner akin to the Waterfall Development model, flexibility is maintained to accommodate necessary adjustments throughout the semester.

## Implementation Language
The game is developed in Arduino, a choice reflecting the educational objective to immerse students in an environment that combines both software and potential hardware interactions, enhancing their understanding of programming principles applied in real-world scenarios.

## Project Features

### Start and Configuration
- **Game Initialization:** Includes options to start or quit the game, transitioning users from the main screen to the initial game setup.
- **Character Customization:** Players input a character name, adhering to validation rules to ensure meaningful input.
- **Difficulty Settings:** Users select from at least three difficulty levels, impacting game dynamics such as starting resources and challenge intensity.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Resource Management:** Players begin with a set amount of money, varying by difficulty, used to purchase and manage towers.
- **Strategic Planning:** The game introduces a path leading to a monument, the focal point of defense against enemy advances. Players must strategically place towers to protect the monument.
- **Tower Defense:** A variety of towers are available for purchase, each with unique characteristics. Placement restrictions prevent towers from being placed on the path, requiring strategic positioning for effective defense.

### Combat and Progression
- **Combat Initiation:** Players can start combat sequences, prompting enemy movements along the path toward the monument.
- **Enemy Diversity:** The game features multiple enemy types, each with distinct behaviors and challenges, requiring players to adapt their defense strategies.
- **Monument Health:** The monument's health varies by difficulty and is central to the game's success criteria. The health decreases if enemies reach the monument, leading to potential game over scenarios.

### Advanced Features
- **Tower Upgrades:** Later stages introduce the ability to upgrade towers, enhancing their defensive capabilities.
- **Final Boss and Victory Conditions:** The culmination of the game features a formidable final boss. Defeating this enemy results in a victory, with the game providing statistics and the option to restart or exit.

## Conclusion
This project is designed to challenge students' programming skills and strategic thinking, offering a comprehensive experience from initial concept to final implementation. The use of Arduino as the development platform underscores the project's emphasis on practical, hands-on learning, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and applied technical skills.
